Kallisto holds **operational secrets**: values your services need often and
fast, whose leak is contained by revoking them. The secrets whose leak would
start a compliance incident or cause irreversible damage stay in Vault or
OpenBao.

## The decision rule

> If this secret leaks and I revoke it within five minutes, is the damage
> contained and recoverable?

**Yes:** a good fit for Kallisto. **No:** keep it in Vault or OpenBao, with
full audit trails, compliance policy and HSM integration.

## What it solves

### Reads that must survive an unreachable upstream

A central secret store has windows where it serves nothing. Vault is sealed
after every restart, a Raft failover means a leader election, and an upgrade
means a careful step-down. A failed secret read rarely degrades gracefully: a
process that cannot fetch its credentials usually does not start at all.

With Kallisto, a request depends on a process on the same machine and a file it
already holds. The secret store that produced the file can be down. The bucket
can be down too: each resolver keeps serving the last authenticated file, and
restarts from its encrypted local copy. A hard runtime dependency on a
quorum-bound system becomes a periodic, offline export.

### Per-request secret access

Reading a secret right before use and discarding it right after keeps
plaintext out of application memory for as long as possible, and makes a
rotation take effect without a restart. Against a central Vault that costs a
network round trip per use. Against Kallisto it is a loopback call answered
from RAM, at latencies around a millisecond. See [performance and
footprint](/kallisto/reference/performance/).

### Edge and unreliable links

Gateways and edge nodes need current certificates and keys but often sit on
links to the core that drop. A resolver per node keeps serving what it has
while the link is down, and picks up the next version when it returns. This
composes with [Helvilette](/helvilette/), which targets the same fleets for the
same reason.

### Removing `.env` files

A sealed file on a bucket, plus a key in the orchestrator's secret store,
replaces plaintext `.env` files on disk, in backups and on laptops. The
application reads through the Vault API it may already speak.

## Good fits

| Secret | Why it fits |
|---|---|
| Internal service-to-service tokens | High read rate, easily revoked |
| Database passwords for non-production | Rotated often, limited scope |
| Session and JWT signing keys for internal apps | Read-heavy, rotatable |
| Cache authentication (Redis `AUTH`) | Sub-millisecond reads wanted, revocable |
| Internal API keys | High throughput, easily regenerated |
| TLS certificates and keys for internal mTLS | Read at connection setup, rotated by automation |
| Configuration encryption keys | Read-dominant, app-scoped |

## Keep these out

| Secret | Why | Where it belongs |
|---|---|---|
| Root CA private keys | Catastrophic if leaked | HSM, or Vault with an HSM backend |
| Live payment keys (`sk_live_...`) | Direct financial loss, PCI-DSS scope | Vault with audit and compliance policy |
| Cloud root credentials | Full account takeover | Vault with MFA and break-glass procedure |
| PII encryption master keys | Regulatory liability | Vault with a FIPS-validated backend |
| SSH keys to production bastions | Direct infrastructure access | Vault SSH engine or signed certificates |
| Release signing keys | Supply-chain attack vector | Air-gapped HSM |

The common reason is the audit log Kallisto does not have. Its access log drops
lines under load, so it cannot prove who read a secret.

```

Nothing syncs the two automatically. An operator or a CI job exports the
operational secrets, seals them into a file with `kallisto-ctl`, and uploads it.
Each machine's Kallisto polls that file.

## When Kallisto is the wrong tool

- **You need dynamic secrets, leases, PKI or transit.** Kallisto serves static
  values from a file.
- **You need an audit trail of reads.** The access log is best-effort.
- **You need something production-grade today.** 2.0.0 is a prototype. See
  [project status](/kallisto/reference/status/).
- **Callers are on other machines.** Kallisto serves loopback only and has no
  network authentication. Run one per machine.
- **Your reads are rare and Vault is comfortable.** A handful of reads at boot
  against a healthy Vault gains little from another component.
